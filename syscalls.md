# Linux System Calls

## Implementation of Calling Convention


The below is taken from `tools/include/nolibc/arch-x86_64.h`:
```
/* Syscalls for x86_64 :
 *   - registers are 64-bit
 *   - syscall number is passed in rax
 *   - arguments are in rdi, rsi, rdx, r10, r8, r9 respectively
 *   - the system call is performed by calling the syscall instruction
 *   - syscall return comes in rax
 *   - rcx and r11 are clobbered, others are preserved.
 *   - the arguments are cast to long and assigned into the target registers
 *     which are then simply passed as registers to the asm code, so that we
 *     don't have to experience issues with register constraints.
 *   - the syscall number is always specified last in order to allow to force
 *     some registers before (gcc refuses a %-register at the last position).
 *   - see also x86-64 ABI section A.2 AMD64 Linux Kernel Conventions, A.2.1
 *     Calling Conventions.
